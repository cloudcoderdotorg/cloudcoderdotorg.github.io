The new year brings a shiny new CloudCoder release: version 0.1.2!  I've finally had some time to spend on CloudCoder after a crazy fall semester. (Note to self: in the future, avoid volunteering to host conferences.)

There are two notable changes.  First, I fixed a regression introduced in version 0.1.1 that caused compilation failures for C++ submissions.  (Sorry for the breakage!)

Second, there are major UI improvements in the home page, courtesy of York College student Shane Bonner (and a bit of work by me as well).  Here's a screenshot (click for full-size version):

Note the "progress summary" widget: it displays a quick visual indication of which exercises have been completed and which remain.  The exercise list has also been simplified, and also sports a status indicator for each exercise.  These changes make it easy for students to see what to work on next.

Another nice improvement is a new user account tab:

<a style="margin-left: 40px;" href="../../../img/user-account-tab.png"><img alt="screenshot of new home page" src="../../../img/user-account-tab-sm.png"></a>

The new user account tab makes it much easier for a user to change his/her password, and also provides access to a detailed course progress view.

See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/cloudcoderdotorg/CloudCoder/wiki/Install) for details on installing CloudCoder.

As always, [let me know](mailto:dhovemey@ycp.edu) if you run into any issues using this release.
