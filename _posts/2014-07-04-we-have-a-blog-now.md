Welcome to the CloudCoder blog!

We decided to start a CloudCoder blog so we can let people know about what is happening with CloudCoder.  We probably won't be posting that often, but we will post when there is a new release, or when we add a feature that we think people might want to know about.  Please feel free to add your comments to any posts you see here: we're interested in hearing about how people are using CloudCoder in their courses, how we might improve CloudCoder, etc.

The current news is that we released version 0.1.0 on June 4th: check out the [installation instructions](https://github.com/cloudcoderdotorg/CloudCoder/wiki/Install) if you're interested in trying it out.
