Welcome to the CloudCoder blog!

We decided to start a CloudCoder blog so we can let people know about what is happening with CloudCoder.  We probably won't be posting that often, but we will post when there is a new release, or when we add a feature that we think people might want to know about.  Please feel free to add your comments to any posts you see here: we're interested in hearing about how people are using CloudCoder in their courses, how we might improve CloudCoder, etc.

The current news is that we released version 0.1.0 on June 4th: check out the [installation instructions](https://github.com/cloudcoderdotorg/CloudCoder/wiki/Install) if you're interested in trying it out.  There are lots of minor improvements, including a new UI layout for working on exercises that puts the exercise description next to the code editor (click for larger image):

<a style="margin-left: 40px;" href="https://raw.github.com/wiki/cloudcoderdotorg/CloudCoder/img/screenshot-cproblem2.png"><img src="http://cloudcoder.org/img/screenshot-cproblem2-sm.png" alt="CloudCoder screenshot" /></a>

This layout makes it quite a bit easier for students to refer to the exercise description as they work.

Until next time!
