CloudCoder version 0.1.4 has been released!  As always, the [Install](https://github.com/cloudcoderdotorg/CloudCoder/wiki/Install) page has information about installing CloudCoder, with [Bootstrap](https://github.com/cloudcoderdotorg/CloudCoder/wiki/Bootstrap) being the preferred installation technique.  (Bootstrap automatically fetches the most recent CloudCoder version, which is now 0.1.4.)

The main user-visible changes are new admin and instructor UIs located on the home page.  These new UIs make it much easier to create a course, register a user, or edit a user than it was previously.

Even though it's been more than a year since the [previous release](2015-01-09-version-0-1-3-released.md), CloudCoder is still under active development.  In fact, the development is about to get significantly more active than usual, because I'm on sabbatical until May.  I'll post updates here.  Stay tuned!
